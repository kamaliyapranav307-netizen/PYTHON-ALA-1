# PYTHON-ALA-1
Students are given a Python program with syntax and logical errors to identify and correct. After debugging and ensuring the program runs correctly, they must upload the completed work to their GitHub repository. Finally, students submit the GitHub link on the GMIU portal. This activity strengthens debugging skills and GitHub usage.
